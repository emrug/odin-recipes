    <p>
        A caprese salad is a summer classic for a reason. You can only make it if your tomatoes are ripe and 
        juicy, otherwise it will be a sad and disapointing dish. Good quality olive oil, balsamic and mozzerella
        are also important for making sure the dish does not taste bland.

            Add around 5-10 basil leaves to each plate depending on how big your bunch is, then add a small drizzle of 
            balsamic vinegar. Enjoy!
